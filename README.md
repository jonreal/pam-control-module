# pam-control-module
Hardware/software project for pneumatic artificial muscles (PAM) control module.

After downloading, move libraries/Pam directory to local Arduino libraries/ directory.
Flash Arduino with example.ino to run the example code. You will see LEDs light up in sequential order if succesful.

NOTE: current hardware version is missing pulldown resistors on digital input
pins -- this will be fixed in the next version.
